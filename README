Custom background
-----------------

This theme was meant to have a custom background, so please change it out to something related to your content ... unless you're really in love with Kill Devil Hills, NC.

The default image size is 1024x768, which is the recommended minimum size. You can upload your own image via the Omeka admin interface by going to Settings -> Theme -> Griddy and clicking 'Configure', where you'll see a file upload. To remove the custom background and return to the default, save changes without uploading a file.

If you would like to do without the full screen background altogether, delete or edit the following lines in the body properties in 'griddy/css/screen.css':

	background: url(../images/bg.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;
	background-size: cover;	
        -webkit-background-size: cover;
        -moz-background-size: cover;
        -o-background-size: cover;
