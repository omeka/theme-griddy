Custom background
-----------------

This theme was meant to have a custom background, so please change it out to something related to your content ... unless you're really in love with Kill Devil Hills, NC.

You can find the background image via 'griddy/images/bg.jpg'. The default image size is 1024x768, which is the recommended minimum size. If you would like to do without the full screen background altogether, delete or edit the following lines in the body properties in 'griddy/css/screen.css':

	background: url(../images/bg.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;
	background-size: cover;	
        -webkit-background-size: cover;
        -moz-background-size: cover;
        -o-background-size: cover;
